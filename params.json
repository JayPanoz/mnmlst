  "body": "mnmlst (“Minimalist” or “Minimal Stylesheet”) is an existentialist CSS framework for eBooks. It doesn’t really help you, it immerses you in an absurd world in which some RS “!important all the things” and abuse the universal selector to override your styles, **destroying the fundamental concept of cascade in doing so.**\r\n\r\nBeware and tamper with mnmlst at your peril.\r\n\r\n## approach\r\n\r\n1. **mnmlst has minimum impact:** it relies on the Reading Systems’ defaults you can’t trust, it only corrects their oversights (e.g. disabling hyphens for headings, resetting HTML5 block elements, applying `max-width` for images, etc.). \r\n2. **mnmlst is freaking light:** the minified css is just 853 bytes. You can achieve your custom typography in less than 2 kilobytes (beautified).\r\n3. **mnmlst is functional:** it follows [FCSS principles](https://blog.colepeters.com/building-and-shipping-functional-css/) and provides single-purpose/reusable classes by default, it doesn’t declare styles for elements directly (excepted oversights).\r\n4. **mnmlst is a toolbox:** the framework was designed using [LESS CSS](http://lesscss.org), it offers multiple tools and can be customized.\r\n\r\nOut of the box, mnmlst doesn’t override anything, whether the defaults are pretty good or absolutely.\r\n\r\nNope, **nothing.** \r\n\r\nIts approach could be abstracted to “If it’s broke beyond repair, don’t try to fix it.” It’s up to you to make use of the single-purpose classes or, should you be a nihilist, just load the stylesheet and claim the job done.\r\n\r\nExistentialism at its best.\r\n\r\n## typography\r\n\r\nmnmlst’s typography is simplistic:\r\n\r\n1. no `font-family` is declared, the default will be used (either the Reading System’s or the user’s);\r\n2. the `line-height` is declared for `body` as a `%` value; it’s like setting a baseline grid in InDesign: all other elements will inherit the **computed** value, as if the correct ratio/em value was automatically recomputed for each element, depending on its `font-size`);\r\n3. a `line-height` override is automatically pushed when the `font-size` of the class/element is bigger that the inherited `line-height`;\r\n4. the modular scale is diatonic—cos’, well, it’s been proving its worth for the last 400 years and that speaks volumes.\r\n5. pagebreaks and alignments can be managed using functional classes as well.\r\n\r\nYou can obviously build on top of it. Once again, it’s up to you.\r\n\r\n## the waste mnmlst doesn’t support\r\n\r\n- Good Old Kindle Mobi7.\r\n- A shitload of apps supporting ePub, especially on Android, because they don’t even support HTML & CSS very well—as a reminder, ePub is using these two languages, which makes the claim of supporting ePub a fucking joke in the first place.\r\n- Web browsers, because they can’t open an ePub file natively.\r\n- Your refusal of responsibility.
